# CocktailDB -> React,UseReducer,Context API project with demonstration of how to use Cocktails API

## Description

1)In this project I have made 4 routes Home,About,Category and single cocktail info

2)In home I have used useEffect tool to get data from the api and show case the cocktails on home page with a quick search where you can type and search through the available cocktails

3)In Home if you want details on a single cocktail then by clicking on details button it will show you the details of that cocktail which I have done by using get by id api

4)Now you can know the different categories of the cocktails and you can select which category of cocktail you want and I have implemented pagination component there not in Home

5)All the logic and api calls are in three files reducer.js,context.js,fetchdata.js i have created reducers for request,get by id,get by category,get error and all
